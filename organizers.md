**Prof. Elena Simperl** is professor of Computer Science at the University of Southampton. Her research interests include knowledge engineering, Social Web technologies, and crowdsourcing. She has contributed and led over 20 national and European research projects and authored more than 100 scientific publications, and chaired the European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) in 2011 and 2012 and International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) in 2016. She was vice-president of STI International until 2016 and the director of the ESWC summer school series. She has co-chaired more than 15 workshops, including the series on Theory and Practice of Social Machines (SOCM) at WWW, Crowdsourcing the Semantic Web at ISWC and Ontology Engineering in a Data Driven World at EKAW.

**Dr. Stefan Dietze**, L3S Research Center, Germany, dietze@L3S.de (http://purl.org/dietze) Dr. Stefan Dietze is a research group leader at the L3S Research Center (Hannover, Germany). His main research interests are in Artificial Intelligence, Web Science and Information Retrieval and the application of these areas to the problem of retrieving, linking and fusing entity-centric Web data. Stefan has been coordinator of a large number of international R&D projects and is involved in a variety of community activities aimed at increasing the take-up of Semantic Web technologies, data and vocabularies. He has published more than 150 papers in major conferences and journals and is organizer, committee and editorial board member for numerous scientific events and publications.

**Prof. Oscar Corcho** is professor at Departamento de Inteligencia Artificial (Facultad de Informática , Universidad Politécnica de Madrid), and he co-leads the Ontology Engineering Group. His research activities are focused on Open Science, Open Data, Semantic Web and Ontological Engineering. In these areas, he has participated in a number of national and European research projects. Previously, he worked as a Marie Curie research fellow at the University of Manchester, and was a research manager at iSOCO. He holds a degree in Computer Science, an MSc in Software Engineering and a PhD in Computational Science and Artificial Intelligence from UPM. He was awarded the Third National Award by the Spanish Ministry of Education in 2001, and the Juan López de Peñalver Award by the Spanish Royal Society of Engineering in 2016. He has published several books, from which “Ontological Engineering” can be highlighted as it is being used as a reference book in a several university lectures worldwide, and more than 100 papers in journals, conferences and workshops. He usually participates in the organisation or in the programme committees of relevant international conferences and workshops.

**Dr. Elena Demidova**, L3S Research Center, Germany, demidova@L3S.de
