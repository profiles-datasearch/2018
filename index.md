## [](#objectives) Objectives and Goals

The web of data has seen tremendous growth recently. New forms of structured data have emerged in the form of web markup, such as schema.org, and a large amount of data in web tables. Considering these rich, heterogeneous and evolving data sources which cover a wide variety of domains, the exploitation of web data becomes increasingly important in the context of various applications, including (federated) search, question answering and fact verification.

The objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in the development of data search techniques, data profiling, and dataset retrieval on the web. This includes looking at the specifics of data-centric information seeking behaviour, understanding interaction challenges in data search on the web, and analysing the cognitive processes involved in the consumption of structured data by users. At the same time we aim to discuss technologies addressing data search – including semantics, information retrieval for web data (ranking algorithms and indexing), in particular in the context of decentralised and distributed systems, such as the web. We are interested in approaches to analyse, characterise and discover data sources. We want to facilitate a discussion around data search across formats and domain-specific applications. 

We envision the workshop as a forum for researchers and practitioners to come together and discuss common challenges and identify synergies for joint initiatives. We welcome contributions describing technical approaches, as well as those related to Human Computer Interaction research in data discovery, profiling and retrieval. 



## [](#topics)Topics and Themes

PROFILES & DATA:SEARCH ’18 seeks application-oriented papers, as well as more theoretical papers and position papers. The workshop proposes a multidisciplinary discussion on the following themes, with a focus on RDF, CSV, JSON and other structured and semi-structured datasets:


### [](#search) Data Search
*   Dataset retrieval
*   Search results presentation for datasets
*   Semantic dataset search
*   Evaluation of dataset search tools and algorithms
*   Decentralised and distributed architectures and algorithms in data search
*   Fusing, cleaning, ranking and refining search results
*   Approaches to personalisation in dataset search
*   Scalability & performance of distributed data queries
*   Query routing taking into account relevance, quality and profiles of distributed datasets

### [](#profiling) Data Profiling
*   Dataset profile representation (vocabularies, schemas)
*   Profiling and assessment of novel forms of entity-centric Web data
*   Data summarisation
*   Data quality analysis for query routing
*   Novel applications using dataset profiles
*   Topic profiling of datasets
*   Dataset indexing and profiling approaches

### [](#human-data-interaction) Human Data Interaction
*    Information seeking behaviour for data
*    User modeling for data search
*    Analysing behavioral traces during data search
*    Usability of data portals and data discovery tools
*    Data search result presentation to support sense making

We are interested in contributions using a variety of methods. This can include, for example, user studies, lab experiments, system based evaluation, but also experiments using gamification and crowdsourcing.

 ## [](#submission) Submission Guidelines

We welcome the following types of contributions:

We encourage full papers (8 pages), short papers (4 pages) as well as position papers (2 pages). All submissions must be written in English and must be formatted according to the ACM format. The  proceedings of the workshop will be included in the companion proceedings of The WebConf2018. Each submission will be reviewed by at least 2 members of the PC. Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, and relevance to the workshop. Please submit your contributions electronically in PDF format via the Easychair system: 
<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=profiles-datasearch2018> 

We follow a single-blind process with at least two reviewers per paper. Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, and relevance to the workshop.
