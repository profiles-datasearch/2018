# [](#objectives) Objectives and Goals

The web of data has seen tremendous growth recently. New forms of structured data have emerged in the form of Web markup, such as schema.org, and a large amount of data in web tables. Considering these rich, heterogeneous and evolving data sources which cover a wide variety of domains, exploitation of web data becomes increasingly important in the context of various applications, including search, question answering and fact verification.

The objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in the development of data search, data profiling and dataset retrieval on the web. This includes looking at the specifics of data centric information seeking behaviour, understanding interaction challenges in data search on the web and the cognitive processes involved in the consumption of structured data by users. At the same time we aim to discuss technologies addressing data search -- including semantics, information retrieval (ranking algorithms and indexing), in particular in the context of decentralised and distributed systems, such as the web. We are interested in approaches to analyse, describe and discover data sources. We want to facilitate a discussion around data search across formats and domain specific applications. 

We envision the workshop as a forum for researchers and practitioners to come together and discuss common challenges and identify synergies for joint initiatives.



# [](#topics)Topics and Themes

The workshop proposes a multidisciplinary discussion with the key focal areas of data search, data profiling and human data interaction:

## [](#search) Data Search
*   Dataset retrieval
*   Search results presentation for datasets
*   Semantic search
*   Evaluation of dataset search tools and algorithms
*   Decentralised and distributed architectures and algorithms in data search
*   Fusing, cleaning, ranking and refining search results
*   Approaches to personalisation in dataset search
*   Scalability & performance of distributed data queries
*   Query routing taking into account relevance and quality of distributed datasets

## [](#profiling) Data Profiling
*   Dataset profile representation (vocabularies, schemas)
*   Profiling and assessment of novel forms of entity-centric Web data
*   Data summarisation
*   Data quality analysis for query routing
*   Novel applications using dataset profiles
*   Topic profiling of datasets
*   Indexing and profiling approaches

## [](#human-data-interaction) Human Data Interaction
*    Information seeking behaviour for data
*    Usability of data portals / data discovery tools
*    Search result presentation to support sense making


# [](#format)Workshop Format

The workshop will span a full day, commencing with a keynote and closing with focused discussion triggered by statements of interest from a core set of speakers. During the workshop, we will have brief presentations of short papers submitted to the workshop as well as a working session. Paper presentations will follow a lightning talk format where most of the time will be dedicated to questions and comments from the audience. For the working sessions the audience will be invited to join roundtables on different topics, defined based on accepted submissions. Authors will be encouraged to submit papers whose length is proportional to their contribution; a maximum number of 8 pages in ACM format is considered appropriate for the topic and aims of the workshop. We are expecting to accept up to 12 papers.

# [](#schedule)Tentative Schedule

Following an introduction by the organisers, the workshop will be opened by a keynote by a distinguished practitioner who can  give  the participants an overview of recent developments around data search. The rest of the morning will involve paper presentation, questions and discussions. For the afternoon we expect to organise 2 to 4 round tables around topics stemming from statements of interest proposed by the authors of accepted papers. Topics will be published on the website on the day of the workshop, the audience will be invited to join one of the round tables. The day will be wrapped up with a summary of discussions from the roundtables, collecting calls for action for future activities and a short reflection on the workshop.
