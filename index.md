# [](#objectives) Objectives and Goals

The web of data has seen tremendous growth recently. New forms of structured data have emerged in the form of web markup, such as schema.org, and a large amount of data in web tables. Considering these rich, heterogeneous and evolving data sources which cover a wide variety of domains, the exploitation of web data becomes increasingly important in the context of various applications, including (federated) search, question answering and fact verification.

The objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in the development of data search techniques, data profiling, and dataset retrieval on the web. This includes looking at the specifics of data-centric information seeking behaviour, understanding interaction challenges in data search on the web, and analysing the cognitive processes involved in the consumption of structured data by users. At the same time we aim to discuss technologies addressing data search – including semantics, information retrieval for web data (ranking algorithms and indexing), in particular in the context of decentralised and distributed systems, such as the web. We are interested in approaches to analyse, characterise and discover data sources. We want to facilitate a discussion around data search across formats and domain-specific applications. 

We envision the workshop as a forum for researchers and practitioners to come together and discuss common challenges and identify synergies for joint initiatives.



# [](#topics)Topics and Themes

PROFILES & DATA:SEARCH ’18 will seek application-oriented papers, as well as more theoretical papers and position papers. The workshop proposes a multidisciplinary discussion on the following themes, with a focus on RDF, CSV, JSON and other structured and semi-structured datasets:


## [](#search) Data Search
*   Dataset retrieval
*   Search results presentation for datasets
*   Semantic dataset search
*   Evaluation of dataset search tools and algorithms
*   Decentralised and distributed architectures and algorithms in data search
*   Fusing, cleaning, ranking and refining search results
*   Approaches to personalisation in dataset search
*   Scalability & performance of distributed data queries
*   Query routing taking into account relevance, quality and profiles of distributed datasets

## [](#profiling) Data Profiling
*   Dataset profile representation (vocabularies, schemas)
*   Profiling and assessment of novel forms of entity-centric Web data
*   Data summarisation
*   Data quality analysis for query routing
*   Novel applications using dataset profiles
*   Topic profiling of datasets
*   Dataset indexing and profiling approaches

## [](#human-data-interaction) Human Data Interaction
*    Information seeking behaviour for data
*    User modeling for data search
*    Analysing behavioral traces during data search
*    Usability of data portals and data discovery tools
*    Data search result presentation to support sense making

We are interested in contributions using a variety of methods. This can include, for example, user studies, lab experiments, system based evaluation, but also experiments using gamification and crowdsourcing.


# [](#format)Workshop Format

The workshop will span a full day, commencing with a keynote and closing with focused discussions triggered by statements of interest from a core set of speakers. During the workshop, we will have brief presentations of the papers submitted to the workshop as well as a working session. Paper presentations will follow a lightning talk format where most of the time will be dedicated to questions and comments from the audience. For the working sessions the audience will be invited to join roundtables on different topics, defined based on the accepted submissions. Authors will be encouraged to submit papers whose length is proportional to their contribution. We encourage full papers, short papers as well as position papers. A maximum number of 8 pages in ACM format is considered appropriate for the aims of the workshop. We are expecting to accept up to 12 papers. 


# [](#schedule)Tentative Schedule

Following an introduction by the organisers, the workshop will open with a keynote talk from a distinguished practitioner who will give participants an overview of recent developments around data search. The rest of the morning will involve paper presentations, questions and discussions. For the afternoon we expect to organise 2 to 4 round tables around topics based on accepted submissions as well as on statements of interest by authors of accepted papers. Topics will be published on the website on the day of the workshop, and the audience will be invited to join one of the round tables. The day will wrap up with a summary of discussions from the round tables, collecting calls to action for future activities and a short reflection on the workshop. The tentative schedule is as follows:

<table style="width:90%;">

<td style="width:96pt;">09:00 – 09:30</td><td>Introduction by organisers</td>

# [](#evaluation) Evaluation of Submissions and Registration

We will follow a single-blind process with at least two reviewers per paper. Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, and relevance to the workshop. The workshop participation will be open to all interested registered parties.
